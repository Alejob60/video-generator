# FLUX-1.1-pro Authentication Methods

## Overview

This document summarizes the authentication methods that work with the FLUX-1.1-pro API and confirms that our implementation is correct.

## Working Authentication Methods

### 1. Authorization: Bearer (Current Implementation)
```javascript
headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`
}
```

### 2. Api-Key Header (Alternative)
```javascript
headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Api-Key': apiKey
}
```

Both methods work correctly with the FLUX API.

## Non-Working Authentication Methods

### Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key (Does Not Work)
```javascript
headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': apiKey
}
```

This method returns a 401 error.

## Implementation Verification

We have verified that our service implementation works correctly:

1. **FLUX API Call**: ✅ Successful
2. **Base64 Decoding**: ✅ Valid PNG data
3. **File System Operations**: ✅ Temporary file creation and cleanup
4. **Azure Blob Storage Upload**: ✅ Successful upload with correct MIME type
5. **Service Endpoint**: ✅ Returns correct response with image URL

## Test Results

- Base64 data length: ~1.5-1.7 MB
- Decoded buffer size: ~1.2-1.3 MB
- PNG header validation: ✅ Valid (89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A)
- Azure Blob Storage upload: ✅ Successful
- Service endpoint response: ✅ Returns image URL

## Conclusion

Our current implementation using `Authorization: Bearer` is correct and working properly. The image corruption issues that were previously reported have been resolved through:

1. Enhanced base64 data validation
2. PNG header verification
3. File system verification
4. Comprehensive logging for debugging

The service is ready for production use.
