# FLUX-1.1-pro Image Generation Service Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the FLUX-1.1-pro image generation service and resolves the image corruption issues that were previously encountered.

## Service Implementation

The service has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### 1. FluxImageService (`src/infrastructure/services/flux-image.service.ts`)

Key features of the enhanced service:
- **Prompt Enhancement**: Uses LLM service to improve image prompts before sending to FLUX
- **Direct API Integration**: Calls the FLUX-1.1-pro endpoint directly with proper authentication
- **Dual Response Handling**: Handles both URL and base64 data responses from FLUX API
- **Enhanced Validation**: Validates base64 data format and PNG headers
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging at each step for debugging
- **Robust Error Handling**: Proper error handling and reporting

### 2. FluxImageController (`src/interfaces/controllers/flux-image.controller.ts`)

- REST endpoint at `/media/flux-image`
- Validates incoming requests using DTO
- Handles user authentication and notification

### 3. GenerateFluxImageDto (`src/interfaces/dto/generate-flux-image.dto.ts`)

- Validates required fields: prompt, plan
- Optional size parameter with valid options

### 4. FluxImageModule (`src/infrastructure/modules/flux-image.module.ts`)

- Registers all necessary components for the FLUX service

## Image Corruption Resolution

The image corruption issues were resolved through the following enhancements:

### 1. Base64 Data Validation
```typescript
// Validate base64 data format
const isValidBase64 = /^[A-Za-z0-9+/]*={0,2}$/.test(imageData.b64_json);
```

### 2. PNG Header Verification
```typescript
// Check PNG file signature
const pngHeader = buffer.slice(0, 8);
const isPng = pngHeader.equals(Buffer.from([0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x1A, 0x0A]));
```

### 3. File System Verification
```typescript
// Verify file was written correctly
const stats = fs.statSync(tempPath);
// Read back and verify
const verifyBuffer = fs.readFileSync(tempPath);
```

### 4. Enhanced Logging
- Detailed logging of each processing step
- Base64 data samples for debugging
- File size verification at each stage

## Correct API Usage

The service correctly calls the FLUX API with the following parameters:

```bash
POST https://labsc-m9j5kbl9-eastus2.services.ai.azure.com/openai/deployments/FLUX-1.1-pro/images/generations?api-version=2025-04-01-preview
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
  Authorization: Bearer {FLUX_API_KEY}
Body:
  {
    "prompt": "Enhanced prompt from LLM service",
    "output_format": "png",
    "n": 1,
    "size": "1024x1024"
  }
```

## Environment Configuration

The service requires the following environment variable in `.env`:
```
FLUX_API_KEY=7PAsgxvIw4v494OveKjy4izsjqpXUp6gCCJOMBZkeT0AYA4zKNpSJQQJ99BDACHYHv6XJ3w3AAAAACOGQKWS
```

## Testing

The service has been tested with various prompts and consistently produces valid PNG images that are successfully uploaded to Azure Blob Storage.

## Payload Format

To use the endpoint, send a POST request to `/media/flux-image` with the following JSON:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Your image description",
  "plan": "FREE|CREATOR|PRO",
  "size": "1024x1024|1024x768|768x1024"  // Optional
}
```

Example:
```json
{
  "prompt": "A beautiful sunset over the ocean",
  "plan": "PRO",
  "size": "1024x1024"
}
```

## Conclusion

The FLUX-1.1-pro image generation service is now fully functional with robust error handling and validation to prevent image corruption. The enhanced logging provides visibility into the entire process for debugging purposes.
